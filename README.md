# PYTHON FLIPPING TILES GAME

Flipping tiles game can be played to test our memory. In this, we have a certain even number of tiles, in which each number/figure has a pair. The tiles are facing 
downwards, and we have to flip them to see them. In a turn, one flips 2 tiles, if the tiles match then they are removed. If not then they are flipped and placed back in 
the position. We keep on doing this until all the tiles have been matched and removed.
